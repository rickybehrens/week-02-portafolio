        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <!-- Content -->
        <div class="flex-row">
            <p>I'm originally from Caracas, Venezuela where I worked in the automotive industry for about 8 years, out
                of which I spent 3 and a half in Japan working for Toyota Motor Corporation. I decided to move to Denver
                in 2014 when I had an opportunity to help the Stanley Brothers with their hemp company. Worked with Hemp
                and CBD for 5 years and then the pandemic hit. After that I worked at a wine shop for a little bit to
                pursue my passion for wines.</p>
            <p>I received a B.S. in Industrial Engineering from the Universidad Santa Maria in Caracas, Venezuela. I
                live a stone's throw away from University of Denver, where I share my house with my wife and 3 and a
                half year old son and our 3 dogs.</p>

            <h2>Work</h2>
            <!-- Content -->
            <div class="flex-row">
                <p>I started my career in Toyota of Venezuela in the Sales and Marketing departments. While working
                    there I was able to be transfered to Japan in two separate ocassions for training purpses. I worked
                    in Toyota Motors Corporation's Nagoya headquaters and my second time working in Japan I was moved to
                    the Tokyo headquaters.</p>
                <p>While working in Japan I had an opportunity to move to Denver and help run a company in the hemp
                    industry. Five years later, the company had grown and was running on it's own, so I decided it was
                    time to go. Took some time of during the pandemic an later worked in a wineshop for a short period
                    of time.</p>
